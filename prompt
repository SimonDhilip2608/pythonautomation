# Enhanced VegasGPT Prompt Engineering

# Replace the current prompt in your analyze_logs method with this improved version:

prompt = f"""
You are a specialized system log analyzer for enterprise applications. Your task is to analyze the following logs from a Verizon system and identify all errors with high precision.

SYSTEM LOGS:
{log_text}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify EVERY error message in these logs
2. For each error found:
   - Extract the EXACT error message text
   - Determine the most likely root cause based on the stack trace and context
   - Classify the severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on error type and potential impact
   - Include the timestamp when the error occurred

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response must be ONLY a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "errors": [
        {{
            "message": "The full error message including any stack trace information",
            "root_cause": "Technical analysis of what caused this error",
            "severity": "Severity classification",
            "timestamp": "When error occurred",
            "service": "The service or component that generated the error"
        }}
    ],
    "summary": "A brief technical summary of the error patterns detected"
}}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Java exceptions like NullPointerException, SQLException, IOException are definite errors
- Log entries with ERROR or SEVERE level must be captured
- Include EVERY individual error - don't summarize or group similar errors
- Focus on technical accuracy in your root cause analysis
- If you find no errors, return an empty errors array but still provide a summary

KNOWN ERROR PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR:
- KafkaMessageListener errors often indicate message processing failures
- GenericDataBaseServiceImpl errors typically relate to database connectivity or query issues
- Exceptions in log messages indicate runtime errors
- Error patterns containing "timeout" suggest service communication issues

Analyze thoroughly and return ONLY the JSON response.
